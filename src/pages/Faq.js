        <Accordion.Header>5. Do I need to have prior experience in tech to join?</Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body>
        No, prior experience in tech is not a requirement to join our college club. For first-year students, no prior experience is necessary; we welcome all levels of interest and enthusiasm for technology. However, as students progress through their academic journey, especially entering the second year, having a strong foundation in relevant curriculum becomes increasingly beneficial.<br/><br/> By the time students reach their third year and beyond, a more substantial background in tech-related subjects is preferred, as the club's activities and projects often involve advanced concepts and practical applications. Regardless of experience level, we encourage all students with an interest in technology to join our club, as we provide opportunities for learning, growth, and collaboration for members at every stage of their academic and technical development.
